    <!-- there are three ways we can use the css inline, internal and the external -->

    <!-- inline -> through style attribute, within the element, not used widely as it will take time -->

    <!-- internal -> style tag used before the head closing tag, for small projects -->

    <!-- external -> style tag css written in another file and imported by link stylesheet tag, used in big projects  -->

    <!-- simple internal css with multiple selectors and its declaration written written below -->
